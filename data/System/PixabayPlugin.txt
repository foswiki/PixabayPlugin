---++ Description

This plugin let's you access over 1 mililion stock images, videos and illuatrations of [[https://pixabay.com/][pixabay]].
Pixabay is a vibrant community of creatives, sharing copyright free images and videos. All contents are released under the [[https://pixabay.com/service/license/][Pixabay License]], which makes them safe to use without asking for permission or giving credit to the artist - even for commercial purposes.

If you se this plugin and this the Pixabay API, a link to Pixabay is required and you may use [[https://pixabay.com/service/about/#goodies][their logo]] for this purpose.
By default, you can make up to 5,000 requests per hour towards pixabay.com. Requests are associated with an API key, and not with your IP address.
In addition this plugin caches query results to pixabay.com for a certain period of time, a day by default. 

Returned images are cached on this server and _not_ hotlinked their source location on pixabay.com. This is not only required due to the API usage guidelines
but also comes with a certain performance advantage compared to other image services such as unsplash.com.
